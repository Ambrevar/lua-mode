*lua-mode* is an "Emacs":emacs major mode for editing "Lua":lua. The development has moved to "github":http://github.com/immerrr/lua-mode, so update your bookmarks if you still look for new releases at luaforge.

If you have a problem or a suggestion about *lua-mode*, please, let me know about it via "issue tracker":tracker.

h2. INSTALLATION

To install, just copy @lua-mode.el@ into a directory on your @load-path@ (and optionally byte-compile it). To set up Emacs to automatically edit files ending in @.lua@ or with a lua hash-bang line using *lua-mode* add the following to your init file:

bc.     (autoload 'lua-mode "lua-mode" "Lua editing mode." t)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.lua$" . lua-mode))
    (add-to-list 'interpreter-mode-alist '("lua" . lua-mode))

h2. USAGE

*lua-mode* supports c-mode style formatting and sending of lines/regions/files to a Lua interpreter. An interpreter (see variable @lua-default-application@) will be started if you try to send some code and none is running. You can use the process-buffer (named after the application you chose) as if it were an interactive shell. See the documentation for @comint.el@ for details.

Lua-mode also works with Hide Show minor mode (see @hs-minor-mode@).
